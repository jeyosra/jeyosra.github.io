__**Real time depth calculation from stereo cameras using Python and OpenCV**__

**Depth calculation?**

If we aim that applications reach the human kind levels of seen and understanding ,first ,machines must have a depth perception.This is why ,we are going to calculate depth(distance between cameras and an objects) and distance between two objects in real time.

**Stereo cameras?**

This allows the camera to simulate human binocular vision. First, both eyes must be accurately aimed at the same target .Then, because the two eyes are located in different positions, each takes in a unique view from its own perspective. The two separate images are sent on to the brain for processing.When the two images arrive simultaneously in the back of the brain they are united into one picture. The combined picture appears three-dimensional (3-D) because it has the added depth dimension. That's stereo vision.
